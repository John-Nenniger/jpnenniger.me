A Simple Personal Site Build in React

https://jpnenniger.me

A work in progress, I'll slowly be adding pages here every once in a while.
Mostly has been an outlet for practicing the design aspects of web development.

Some notable features: 
- Custom Webpack Config
- React and React Router FrontEnd
- No Backend
- No CSS framework 
- SCSS styles


Not looking for colaborators, but feel free to use aspects of this project
if you're getting a simple React site up and running.
